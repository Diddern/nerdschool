You'll need something that gives you a bash-like shell. If you're using a *nix
system or OSX you'll be fine, if you're using Windows you can for instance
download git and use the shell that comes with it (http://git-scm.com/downloads
Remember to opt in for Git Bash when installing). 

Some useful tools and a short intro to what they do: 
1) Navigation
    - ls : what's in this directory? 
    - pwd : where am I standing in the file system?
    - cd : take me to indicated directory
    - find : find a file from given directory in the file tree 

2) Getting an overview:
    - history : show me the commands I've run
	- tail  : read me the last lines of a file 
	- head : read me the first lines of a file 
	- less : non-editable view of a file 
	- cat : list contents of a file to standard out 
    - grep : search for a given expression

3) Files and directories:
    - mkdir : make a directory
    - cp : copy a file or directory
    - mv : move a file or directory 
    - rm : delete a file or directory
    - chmod : change file permissions 
    - touch : change last-modified timestamp of a file without editing it

4) Editing: 
    - vim/vi : shell editor with command mode and insert mode
    - sed : regular expressions (change occurences of patterns)
    - awk : editing columns of text or numbers

5) Scripting basics
    - echo : print to screen (think System.out.println)
    - pipe | send the output (pipe the output) to the next command
    - > and < : redirecting input and output streams
    - for 
    - if
    - variables

6) Remote
    - ssh : securely log in to a remote box
    - scp : send files from one box to another with ssh 
    - rsync : synchronise files locally or remote
    - wget : gets files over http
    - curl : gets files over http 

7) How do I get help? 
    - google is, as always, your friend
    - man <command> 

8) Nice to know about systems: 
    - PATH : Your OS will search for executables in these locations (such as
      java, python and anything you might install yourself)
    - environment variables
    - dot-files : hidden files , e.g. .bashrc
    - sudo : perform tasks as super user (with great power comes great
      responsibility) (on windows you can use "run as Administrator")

9) Scripting: 
    - #! (shebang)
    - file permissions and file ownership
	- ssh 
    - combining commands
    - find and grep 
    - grep, sed, awk
    - for loops
