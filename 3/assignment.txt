Create a simple game. Push at least once for each requirement you implement.

Part One
- Create a <canvas> element of 400 by 400 pixels
- When clicking inside the canvas, draw a square
- Make the square move in a single direction

Part Two
- Bounce back square when reaching the edge
- Change color when a square collides with another square
- Set a random speed
- Change direction when colliding
- Remove square when clicking on it

Part Three
- Add a <div> with a short explanation of how the game works, make it look good
- Make the canvas stretch to fill the window size
- Make the explanation hang in a corner, on top of the canvas.
