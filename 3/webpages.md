Web pages consist of content, looks and behaviour.

HTML is the structured content. It is organised with TAGS.

CSS is about making the content look a particular way. CSS consists of CLASSES that are applied to HTML TAGS.

JavaScript is about the behaviour of the page. JavaScript is a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE that manipulates the HTML based on EVENTS.

(JavaScript can also be used on its own, outside web pages)
