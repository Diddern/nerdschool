TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It is a disciplined approach to writing code that result in well-structured legible code, with less logical errors.

When you Test Drive your code, you start with writing a test, expressing what the code needs to do. You then write code to prove that test (make the test pass). It is a bit like double entry book-keeping.

Like most disciplined approaches, TDD can be tedious. The reward, especially in complex systems, is much less time spent on fixing logical errors (and creating new ones in the process).
