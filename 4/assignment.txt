Today you will redo all the code from week 3 in a test driven way. Buckle up - this will be hard.

There is a sample folder with code that may help you.

1) You are going to DELETE all the javascript code from week three and start with a blank slate. 
2) Use the sample files to set up a project that has a tests.html page for your tests, and an index.html page for your game
3) Solve the problems from week 3 using a test-first approach:
    - write a test for the code you wish you had
    - write only enough code to make the test pass
    - write another test, and just enough code to make it pass

Remember to commit and push often.

Some hints:
- Calculating the square movements and actually drawing the square are seperate concerns.
- The test framework is extremely minimal. You can modify it to print more useful information.
- Smaller functions and objects are easier to test.
- Try keeping code that touches anything outside your control (canvas, document) small and as isolated as possible. We will not test this code today.
